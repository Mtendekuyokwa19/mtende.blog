# A Jujutsu later

**What does the next generation of version-control-system look like...**

After being in rooms where people struggled to understand git to its core or even adopt it in their daily workflow _git might not be it_.

Most people who "successed" with learning git, usually just know enough commands to push to github or get unstack. But in extreme cases of being stuck the repo is re-cloned. Skill issue? **Maybe**

But isn't technology supposed to bridge skill issue that is why it is "technology"

With git, we are in a state where most people simply parrot documentation and memorise a handfull of commands so much that they become second nature but most do not understand the metal and cannot justify why the internal design of the vcs is like that.

I thought this was what vcs was supposed to be like: something complex, I cannot understand so I thought this lack of knowledge was OK.

Then I tried Jujutsu!

## Skeptical

All tech which is announced is crowned as "revolutionary". I have installed software flagged as revolutionary
and it was all just someone reinventing the wheel, very minimal productivity gains. When jujutsu was mentioned 3 different times: [by gregory, neovim core](https://youtu.be/SnhcXR9CKno?t=905), [Maddie on HN post](https://maddie.wtf/posts/2025-07-21-jujutsu-for-busy-devs) and an old tweet by [Mitchell, ghostty creator](https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1928597859407990902)

I ended up on a conclusion that I tweeted:

> Went through the Jujutsu docs and it smells like someone trying to reinvent the wheel.
> Git is fine.

This tweet made me feel like I made a professional opinion on a technology with zero skin in the game. I mean
people do that but I felt off saying something so confidently without installing it on my PC.

The jujutsu docs do not do justice to the technology. During my skimming I stumbled on "TODO" sections, symbolizing undocumented content. This sprouted the idea that this is simply a toy project that might die off.

Extra skepticism, came from the fact that google has some of its hands in it. But the good news is **this is not a google product**. From the ReadMe Martin,the creator, stated:

> I (Martin von Zweigbergk) started Jujutsu as a hobby project in late 2019, and it has evolved into my full-time project at Google, with several other Googlers (now) assisting development in various capacities. That said, this is not a Google product.

## A philosophical-change

Jujutsu is not mature enough to be used solo so you still have your favourite vcs,git. But here is the twist:
It is simply a different workflow style, tapping in some play with [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) type of workflow. Working branchless .Sometimes the best way to understand a tool is to use another tool.

## Sweet points of Jujutsu

1. Choosing to leave conflicts unresolved
1. jj log is beautiful
1. commiting before or after
1. Intergration with formaters w/ jj fix
1. Working branchless
1. Cool+small community: Questions are answered politely
