TL;DR Jujutsu is weird and that is a good thing

## Introduction 

Earlier last week I sent out a tweet:

> Went through the Jujutsu docs   and it smells like someone trying to reinvent the wheel.
> Git is fine.
(I hope martin forgives me for this)
I sent this out before I got my hands dirty with actual installation of jj and trying to colocate it w/ my repos. 

A message that made me get my hands dirty with it was an HN post:
> HN is divided into 2 sides when Jujutsu is mentioned: one that has not tried it because their skeptical and one that has tried it so this is a good indicator that you should try it
