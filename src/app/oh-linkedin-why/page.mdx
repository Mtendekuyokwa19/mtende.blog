## TL;DR
Linkedin, the great place to share your projects whithout feeling the guilt of blowing your own horn.
I think in terms of comparison between linkedin and instagram, linkedin has alot of fakers than instagram. And the lies on linked in are the best because they contain
some truth in them. All the best lies contain some truth and that is why linkedin is so flawed.

## What linkedin misses
One thing I learnt from my supervisor when I was applying to US colleges was your essays should show and not tell. Linkedin users will spend 4-8 paragraphs to tell you how there arduino robot light switching project will help solve the gender equlity problems and boost their country's economy. It rubs me wrong. I want you to show me a project you are working on and tell me the goals you were trying to meet not blow it out of proportion. Maybe it is my ignorance or lack of awareness of how this boost your social rankings but trying to deceive people when they know you are lying is just weak.

## I want recognition

If you are good at something, you will be recognized. The internet has a way of taking care of creatives. I have seen people find jobs by running a website on a disposable vape. If you do unique things and share them on Twitter, bluesky or Hackernews or even a simple blog. Someone will find you and appreciate your work.

## Don't fight the system
This is not a call to delete your account. I simply want you to be aware that people claim one thing on linkedin and blow themselves up.

## Slop land
As the internet is slowly becoming full of slop linkedin is leading in the corporate slop. I do not trust posts written without grammatical errors espcially if they have more than 5 paragraphs.  

I went on a spree of using gptzero extension to check for AI on the posts and wow. I lost respect for most of the people. I mean you have a PhD and have worked on a project that meets the SDGs but you cannot write? how ironic. 

I mean how low are you as a person to even use AI picture of yourself as a header?
