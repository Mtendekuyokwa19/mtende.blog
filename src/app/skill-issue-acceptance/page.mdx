Rob pike gave a talk in 2015 titled: [Simplicity is complicated](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM?si=PjULFwew0dfz5TVY). It has had me reflecting about all times I complained about a language.

I view technology as making innovation bend to our personal needs but this is *wrong* . Rust for instance will make you bend to its needs by being extra verbose because if you allowed to roam freely you have unnecessary bugs. 

So this lead to a not so orthodox definition of skill issue as *one's inability to shape-shift to fit a technologies needs* 
Rob pike stated in the talk that "adding more features to a language leads to more permutations of solving a problem" and being a go-lang beginner I recollected   arguing with people on the go-lang discord server about having classes in go and adding methods to the classes over the "hack" go has of having structs with methods.

The point I am trying to converge to is that-- when you are using a new tool you will have use it with the mentality it was designed in not with the *philosophy* of where you are coming from.

Watching a talk by the creator or core members lets you understand the _whys_. Now I guess I will write go with a go mentality and less of a typescript mentality. This has led me to believe that there is no bad technology, just the wrong users.
