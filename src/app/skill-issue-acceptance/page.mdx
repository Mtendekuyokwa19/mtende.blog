# Skill Issue acceptance

Rob pike gave a talk in 2015 titled [Simplicity is complicated](https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM?si=PjULFwew0dfz5TVY). It has had me reflecting upon all the times I complained about a language design. From scheme to php and even python, but I forgot one thing when I was making my claims: that this is technology.

We view technology as "_making innovation bend to our personal needs_". This is somewhat a tunnel vision point-of-view, It just part of the pie not the whole cake. Rust for instance, will make you bend to its needs by being extra verbose because if you're allowed to roam freely, you have unnecessary bugs, we see this dilemma in most loosly typed languages. A better view of technology is "_I want you to do X for me, what rules should I follow for you to do it for me_".

Lets step out and define skill-issue. This is a not so orthodox definition of skill issue. I define it as *one's inability to shape-shift to fit a technologies needs*.
Rob pike stated in the talk that "adding more features to a language leads to more permutations of solving a problem" and being a go-lang beginner I recollected   arguing with people on the go-lang discord server about having classes in go over the "hack" go has of having structs with methods.

The point I am trying to converge to is that-- when you are using a new tool you will have use it with the mentality it was designed in not with the *philosophy* of where you are coming from. In this sense with go, having classes would create a redundancy.

So a better approach to new technology is reading the philosophy section most people skip or better yet watch a talk by the creator or core members as it lets you understand the _whys_. Now I guess I will write go with a go mentality and less of a typescript mentality.

I have somewhat come to a conclusion that there is no bad technology just the wrong users.
