## About
Hello, I'm Mtende Kuyokwa.

I am sadly still in school studying for an information technology degree. Rumor has it degrees are important.

When I am not prioritizing school, I am playing with [neovim](https://neovim.io/), [jujutusu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/github/), [typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/) and ricing [swayfx](https://github.com/owpk/dotfiles-swayfx).
